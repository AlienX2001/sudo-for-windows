To use it seamlessly just but the bat file in your PATH directory.
If you dont know what PATH is then just type 'echo %PATH%' in your cmd.exe to get a list of directories in your PATH environment variable.
If you still dont seem to understand what's happening then just put it in your "C:\Windows" folder.

Now you can just do 'sudo' from your cmd shell
